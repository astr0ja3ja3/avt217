    <h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>Straightforward and simple. You can just scroll down to navigate the website, there are several easy links to click on. Majority of things have labels so things are not hard to find. There's also a top toolbar that you can use to find what you're looking for exactly</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Different options to choose from. You can just scroll down to navigate the website, there are several easy links to click on. You can also use the upper tab to access the menu.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>Readable. Colors aren't to bright making texts not unreadable. Some headings are small, they blend together in size, making it hard to tell which are paragraphs and what are titles.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Color scheme is fitting and eye catching. The scheme fits the feeling of San Juan as a whole (tropical=bright colors).</p>
